From our research, more Azure partners do this than C.\r\n\r\nThis last bucket is where we need to shine and differentiate ourselves from the competition.\r\nIt will need to account for:\r\n- Listening on new IP Addresses / ports\r\n- SNI and being able to dynamically lookup a cert based on the client hello\r\n- route based on the hierarchy of the URI path \u0026 query string\r\n\r\nFor some apps, they may need to do a DB lookup to discover the cert/route based on the URL being passed - so will need to have a cache and fallback mechanism.\r\n\r\nPerformance would dictate you probably need optimized structures like a trie, that I suspect are behind the existing routing tables.

                "DescriptionMarkdown": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nAdds \u0060Microsoft.ReverseProxy.ServiceFabricIntegration\u0060 which implements dynamic discovery of Service Fabric services. The general architecture takes inspiration from [Traefik\u0027s Service Fabric integration](https://docs.traefik.io/v1.7/configuration/backends/servicefabric/), and is designed for easy and friction-free onboarding of multiple Service Fabric services operating behind YARP. Running multiple instances of YARP in the same cluster is possible, and an eventual consistency model helps avoid the need for any external storage except for the runtime Service Fabric queries used to dynamically discover services in the cluster.\r\n\r\nA Service Fabric service that wants to leverage YARP simply needs to add an \u0060\u003CExtension\u003E\u0060 element in their \u0060ServiceManifest\u0060, for example (see complete example further below):\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060xml\r\n\u003CExtensions\u003E\r\n  \u003CExtension Name=\u0022YARP\u0022\u003E\r\n    \u003CLabels xmlns=\u0022http://schemas.microsoft.com/2015/03/fabact-no-schema\u0022\u003E\r\n      \u003CLabel Key=\u0022YARP.Enable\u0022\u003Etrue\u003C/Label\u003E\r\n      \u003CLabel Key=\u0022YARP.Routes.route1.Hosts\u0022\u003Eexample.com\u003C/Label\u003E\r\n    \u003C/Labels\u003E\r\n  \u003C/Extension\u003E\r\n\u003C/Extensions\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n\r\n## Functional overview\r\nThis works by periodically querying Service Fabric for all applications in a Service Fabric cluster. For each application, we enumerate all services. For each service, we extract its _labels_ and, if the service has opted in to use YARP (\u0060YARP.Enable=true\u0060). If the service that has opted in to use YARP, we then enumerate all partitions, and all instances/replicas within each partition.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Service Fabric concepts mappings to YARP\r\n\r\nService Fabric terminology|YARP terminology\r\n-|-\r\nCluster|--\r\nApplication|--\r\nService (e.g. \u0060fabric:/App1/Svc2\u0060)|Cluster (ClusterId=ServiceName)\r\nInstance / replica|Destination (Address=instance\u0027 or replica\u0027s endpoint)\r\n\u0060YARP.Routes.\u003CrouteName\u003E.*\u0060 in ServiceManifest|ProxyRoute (id=ServiceName\u002BrouteName, Match=Hosts,Path extracted from the labels)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dynamic configurability\r\nLabels defined in the Service Manifest support the following scenarios:\r\n* Arbitrary key / value pair. Only keys understood by us are honored, and unknown keys are ignored\r\n* Application parameter reference. If the label value is of the form \u0060[appParamName]\u0060, its value will be replaced at runtime with the value of the application parameter with the same name defined for the application the service belongs to\r\n* Naming Service overrides. If label \u0060YARP.EnableDynamicOverrides\u0060 is specified as \u0060true\u0060, we will also query Service Fabric Naming Service to discover any [named properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/servicefabric/sfclient-index-property-management). Any _properties_ found for the service being enumerated take precedence over values specified in ServiceManifest. This functionality is opt-in, and disabled by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designed for high availability\r\n\r\nWe keep a cache of the last discovery results obtained from Service Fabric. If at any point, for whatever reason, we are not able to retrieve an updated view of the cluster, we will continue to operate with last-known-good data. The cache is kept in memory, but could be extended to support permanent storage on disk to also survive reboots.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designed for use by large teams\r\nThis integration is designed to support tens of Service Fabric services hosted behind YARP, and it provides additional features to help owners of those teams self-service their devops requirements relating to YARP. When we successfully discovered a service, we emit a [Service Fabric health report](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-health-introduction) against the discovered service. If any config errors are encountered, a Warning health report is issued, which makes it easy for the service owners to observe the errors on Service Fabric Explorer and / or telemetry. This closes the loop and makes it easy for a service in Service Fabric to confirm that its configurations are being honored and to detect any issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Complete ServiceManifest example:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060xml\r\n\u003CServiceManifest Name=\u0022Service1Pkg\u0022 Version=\u00221.0.0\u0022 xmlns=\u0022http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric\u0022\u003E\r\n  \u003CServiceTypes\u003E\r\n    \u003CStatelessServiceType ServiceTypeName=\u0022Service1Type\u0022 \u003E\r\n      \u003CExtensions\u003E\r\n        \u003CExtension Name=\u0022YARP\u0022\u003E\r\n          \u003CLabels xmlns=\u0022http://schemas.microsoft.com/2015/03/fabact-no-schema\u0022\u003E\r\n            \u003CLabel Key=\u0022YARP.Enable\u0022\u003Etrue\u003C/Label\u003E\r\n            \u003CLabel Key=\u0022YARP.Routes.route1.Hosts\u0022\u003Eexample.com\u003C/Label\u003E\r\n            \u003C!-- Optional: enable health probes --\u003E\r\n            \u003CLabel Key=\u0027YARP.Backend.Healthcheck.Enabled\u0027\u003Etrue\u003C/Label\u003E\r\n            \u003CLabel Key=\u0027YARP.Backend.Healthcheck.Path\u0027\u003Eapi/health\u003C/Label\u003E\r\n            \u003CLabel Key=\u0027YARP.Backend.Healthcheck.Timeout\u0027\u003E30\u003C/Label\u003E\r\n            \u003CLabel Key=\u0027YARP.Backend.Healthcheck.Interval\u0027\u003E10\u003C/Label\u003E\r\n          \u003C/Labels\u003E\r\n        \u003C/Extension\u003E\r\n      \u003C/Extensions\u003E\r\n    \u003C/StatelessServiceType\u003E\r\n  \u003C/ServiceTypes\u003E\r\n\r\n  \u003C!-- ... --\u003E\r\n\u003C/ServiceManifest\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n\r\n## Remaining work:\r\n\r\n* [x] \u0060ServiceDiscoveryConfigApplier\u0060 needs to be cleaned up and wired up.

Within a load balancing set we assume all servers are equally able to handle a request aside from considerations of health and load. You\u0027d select a test group and then load balance within that group.\r\n- This should take advantage of the routing layer.

This means that often multiple proxy instances can see the same nodes as under-utilized and send a storm of requests to it (if the incoming traffic is randomly balanced, as tends to be the case).\r\n\r\nThe \u0022Power of Two Choices\u0022 model (discussed in some sources below) adds a degree of randomness by first selecting two random backends and **then** making a \u0022least-outstanding-requests\u0022 decision between those two. This helps to prevent these storms of traffic. This doesn\u0027t generally perform better than Least Requests/Connections in a single-node proxy deployment, but it can be better than Random in situations where each node doesn\u0027t have perfect knowledge of the load\r\n\r\n#### Sources\r\n* [NGINX and the \u201CPower of Two Choices\u201D Load-Balancing Algorithm](https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-power-of-two-choices-load-balancing-algorithm/)\r\n* [Test Driving \u201CPower of Two Random Choices\u201D Load Balancing](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/power-of-two-load-balancing/)\r\n* [Michael Mitzenmacher. 2001.

                    "DescriptionMarkdown": "### Describe the bug\r\nI\u0027ve been running some benchmarks on my local machine for my API gateway that is currently using Ocelot, but that I\u0027m in the process of migrating to YARP. To perform the benchmarks I\u0027ve been using [Crank](https://github.com/dotnet/crank) from the .NET team, which is awesome by the way.\r\n\r\nWhat I\u0027ve seen so far is that if the downstream service I\u0027m proxying to is using HTTP, YARP is much faster than Ocelot. For example, here are the results for my current gateway using Ocelot:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nFirst Request (ms):   850\r\nRequests:             18,068\r\nBad responses:        0\r\nMean latency (us):    214,006\r\nMax latency (us):     499,452\r\nRequests/sec:         1,181\r\nRequests/sec (max):   7,272\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nWhile these are the results for a similar scenario, but using YARP:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nFirst Request (ms):   1,205\r\nRequests:             48,984\r\nBad responses:        0\r\nMean latency (us):    78,480\r\nMax latency (us):     2,128,675\r\nRequests/sec:         3,258\r\nRequests/sec (max):   13,420\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nThose are not too shabby, although the max latency for YARP is interesting. Do note that my Ocelot based gateway is running on .NET Core 3.1, while my YARP gateway is running on .NET 5 Preview 7.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I ran the same benchmark with the gateway proxying to the downstream service using HTTPS, I\u0027m seeing very different results:\r\n\r\n**Ocelot:**\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nFirst Request (ms):   1,088\r\nRequests:             12,819\r\nBad responses:        0\r\nMean latency (us):    301,467\r\nMax latency (us):     3,571,386\r\nRequests/sec:         839\r\nRequests/sec (max):   7,944\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n**YARP:**\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\nFirst Request (ms):   1,631\r\nRequests:             527\r\nBad responses:        515\r\nMean latency (us):    9,021,413\r\nMax latency (us):     10,132,335\r\nRequests/sec:         18\r\nRequests/sec (max):   6,587\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nObviously the number of bad responses triggered me, so I\u0027ve looked into the logs to see if I can figure out what\u0027s going wrong. I see a lot of these exceptions:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n[04:31:02.965] System.OperationCanceledException: The operation was canceled.\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at System.Threading.CancellationToken.ThrowOperationCanceledException()\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.AwaitableSocketAsyncEventArgs.ThrowException(SocketError error, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.AwaitableSocketAsyncEventArgs.GetResult(Int16 token)\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at System.Net.Security.SslStream.\u003CFillHandshakeBufferAsync\u003Eg__InternalFillHandshakeBufferAsync|180_0[TIOAdapter](TIOAdapter adap, ValueTask\u00601 task, Int32 minSize)\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at System.Net.Security.SslStream.ReceiveBlobAsync[TIOAdapter](TIOAdapter adapter)\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at System.Net.Security.SslStream.ForceAuthenticationAsync[TIOAdapter](TIOAdapter adapter, Boolean receiveFirst, Byte[] reAuthenticationData, Boolean isApm)\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at System.Net.Http.ConnectHelper.EstablishSslConnectionAsyncCore(Stream stream, SslClientAuthenticationOptions sslOptions, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at System.Net.Http.HttpConnectionPool.ConnectAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, Boolean allowHttp2, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at System.Net.Http.HttpConnectionPool.CreateHttp11ConnectionAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at System.Net.Http.HttpConnectionPool.GetHttpConnectionAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at System.Net.Http.HttpConnectionPool.SendWithRetryAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, Boolean doRequestAuth, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at Microsoft.ReverseProxy.Service.Proxy.HttpProxy.NormalProxyAsync(HttpContext context, HttpRequestMessage upstreamRequest, Transforms transforms, HttpMessageInvoker httpClient, ProxyTelemetryContext proxyTelemetryContext, CancellationToken shortCancellation, CancellationToken longCancellation)\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at Microsoft.ReverseProxy.Telemetry.TextOperationLogger\u00601.ExecuteAsync(String operationName, Func\u00601 action)\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at Microsoft.ReverseProxy.Middleware.ProxyInvokerMiddleware.Invoke(HttpContext context)\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.EndpointMiddleware.\u003CInvoke\u003Eg__AwaitRequestTask|6_0(Endpoint endpoint, Task requestTask, ILogger logger)\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization.AuthorizationMiddleware.Invoke(HttpContext context)\r\n[04:31:02.965]    at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.DeveloperExceptionPageMiddleware.Invoke(HttpContext context)\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nThat looks like it is somehow not able to complete the SSL handshake with the downstream service, but my Ocelot based gateway doesn\u0027t have that same problem and both are going to the exact same service. That service is running on ASP.NET Core 3.1 by the way.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\u003C!--\r\nWhat steps can we follow to reproduce the issue?\r\n\r\n\r\nGot Exceptions?

As we look ahead on how we continue to make .NET a compelling platform for developers to build their modern apps on, we need to continue to evolve the platform by building on top of what .NET 5 has brought to the ecosystem. AOT in particular, is an area where we need to start to make more investments, which will likely span across several upcoming releases of .NET. Many developers want a specific solution when they refer to \u201CAOT.\u201D They want a solution that has the following characteristics: extremely fast startup, no IL present (for size and obfuscation reasons), a JIT is (at most) optional, and binary size is as small as it can be. We use the term \u201Cnative AOT\u201D to describe that point on the AOT spectrum. The single file solution we have in .NET 5.0 doesn\u2019t satisfy this definition of AOT. It\u2019s a big step forward, but it isn\u2019t \u201Cnative AOT.\u201D\r\n\r\nA recent [Native AOT community survey](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/41522), showed us that there\u2019s more of a need to officially support native AOT in .NET. 52% of our survey respondents (n=1,344) told us that they would like to write more projects in .NET (but can\u2019t) or have written .NET projects in a different environment (Rust and Go) because of missing native AOT options.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nThis objective describes the continued investment and evolution in the features and integration of single file, trimming, and source generators (to name just a few). Many of these areas are complimentary to each other such that a characteristic of source generators for example is that it can help remove major barriers to linker-based and AOT (ahead-of-time) compilation optimizations.\r\n\r\nMany of these areas will require ecosystem and library authors to participate in as well (i.e. trimming) and we will need to build specific tooling to enable these features to be utilized in libraries and will need an outreach program for them as well. We\u2019ve also identified that many of the top NuGet packages people make heavy use of reflection to discover types at runtime. Incorporating these packages is essential for most .NET apps, so the \u201Clinkability\u201D and ability for your code to make use of AOT compiler optimizations is greatly affected. We\u2019re looking forward to working with our wonderful OSS community to see how these packages could use source generators and improve the overall .NET ecosystem.\r\n\r\n# User Stories\r\n\r\n- [ ] Start the journey to enable Native AOT in runtimelabs https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/issues/248\r\n- [ ] Developers can confidently generate single file apps that work for the supported target platforms #43540\r\n- [ ] Annotate more .NET libraries (trimming) and guidance for library authors #43543\r\n- [ ] Expand .NET WebAssembly Capabilities\r\n- [ ] Support assembly load context throughout the product #43544\r\n- [ ] Source generators continue to assist with runtime and framework features #43545",

This is a reversal of a multi-decade trend to deliver dependencies as shared libraries. The benefits to deployment and the ability to optimize a single app outweigh the benefits of sharing for certain types of workloads. The gain is most significant for workloads with a high number of deployed instances: cloud infrastructure, hyper-scale services, popular apps or games. The number of apps of this type is relatively small, but they are highly visible, impactful, and often cost a lot of money to operate (savings can be meaningful).\r\n\r\nEmerging programming environments (e.g. Go, Rust) tend to be designed for this form factor. Established programming environments are catching up on this trend to be relevant for this highly visible segment, for example Java Graal, Dart, Kotlin/Native.\r\n\r\nVarious implementations of .NET (Xamarin, Unity, .NET Native) have demonstrated that .NET is well suited to native AOT in terms of fundamentals, however, there are tools experience and ecosystem challenges that currently prevent .NET from being a great general purpose solution. We intend to start addressing these issues with this project. It is very likely that the first set of improvements will have rough edges that may prevent adoption for some developers. We will use feedback to determine which experience issues to prioritize. We are also not comitting to any particular end point for this project, at this time.\r\n\r\nThis high level section sets our intention to invest in native AOT scenarios and more definition from the teams will be needed to define our phased approach over the next few .NET releases.\r\n\r\n# Work Items\r\n\r\n- [ ] Developer experience\r\n  - [ ] Developers have a way to tell IDE that they are targeting Native AOT \r\n  - [ ] Developers should be shown errors/warnings for AOT incompatible code during development\r\n  - [ ] Inner loop experience for AOT projects\r\n- [ ] Framework annotations - shared with Trimming\r\n  - [ ] Additional annotations for Native AOT specific problem areas\r\n- [ ] Blazor Experience\r\n",

                        "DescriptionMarkdown": "### Improving handling of native Libraries code in embedded/singlefile scenarios\r\n\r\nFor reasons that vary .Net libraries rely on nontrivial amount of native code. The native code is factored into a few well-known native dynamic-link libraries (.dll, .so, etc). As an example we have 4 libraries like this on Linux \u2013 \u0022libSystem.Native\u0022, \u0022libSystem.IO.Compression.Native\u0022, \u0022libSystem.Net.Security.Native\u0022, \u0022libSystem.Security.Cryptography.Native.OpenSsl\u0022. The number of libraries varies depending on platform.\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple model which has its own advantages. In particular there is no need for coreclr to have any special knowledge about these libraries.\r\n\r\nWhere this becomes inconvenient and fragile is when we want to package the native libraries differently - for example as a part of a single file host. To handle such requirement in the current implementation we produce static libraries for the native code and link that into coreclr/host. Since the native dlls are not longer around in this configuration, coreclr intercepts loading of these libraries and redirects to the containing host binary.\r\n\r\nThere is a number of issues:\r\n-\tSince coreclr and libraries are built separately, there is a possibility of a mismatch that could make them incompatible. (i.e. Debug vs. Release, different versions of libc, new/free operator mismatch ...)\r\n-\tIntercepting and redirecting the load happens in PAL layer. This is a problem when the same must be done on Windows.\r\n-\tAccessing the native methods via regular PInvokes requires that the native host re-exports the methods. That easily runs into platform or linker dependent behaviors regarding re-exporting of library functions from final executables.\r\n\r\n**Proposal:**\r\n\r\n-\tBuild native libraries as a part of CoreClr build.\r\nThe source files should still be located under Libraries partition, so that they can be shared in source form with Mono, for example.\r\n\r\n-\tThe \u201Cembedded\u201D case builds native libraries as a part of coreclr binary, thus bypassing the explicit lib files.\r\n\r\n-\tThe \u0022embedded\u0022 case recognizes well-known libraries as a special case of [QCall](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/design/coreclr/botr/corelib.md#calling-from-managed-to-native-code) and dispatches calls to the embedded implementations.\r\nExample: \u201ClibSystem.Native\u201D would normally be a name of the native library to load, but in \u201Cembedded\u201D case, the DLLEXPORT methods of libSystem.Native would be registered in the runtime similarly to QCall and \u201ClibSystem.Native\u201D would be recognized as  another QCall variety.\r\nQCall mechanism here allows us to \u201Cshim\u201D the location of native methods while not changing the managed code that calls them.\r\n\r\n-\tThe QCall registration table for the native calls will be automatically generated by scanning managed libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Some unresolved details:**\r\n-\tIf managed callers are built after coreclr, we would need to reconcile how to do the QCall generation before coreclr builds.\r\n-\tShould the generation of QCall entries be a part of the build (producing a temporary source file) or a dev-time step (the file is explicitly generated and stored in Git).\r\n",

                "DescriptionMarkdown": "The trimming story is a journey where we are improving the capabilities release to release. With .NET 5, we have added the linker capability for trimming and started the annotation effort for the framework.\r\n\r\nFor an application to be correctly fully trimmable, we need to know all the places where dynamic code patterns such as reflection and reflection emit are used. Along with that we will provide annotations for the linker so that it knows how to find the required types so that they are not trimmed, provide a source generator equivalent, or if the functionality is inherently supportable in conjunction with trimming then to provide an error to the app developer.\r\n\r\n# Goals\r\n\r\n* Developers should have clarity on whether the application will be trimmable\r\n* Trimming should be possible for all mainline scenarios. Work with owners for each of the workloads to:\r\n  * define the mainline scenarios\r\n  * remove / mitigate issues in libraries for the mainline scenarios\r\n  * supply representative apps for validation\r\n* Linker should produce an error for every case where trimming will fail\r\n* Remove \u0022Preview\u0022 tag from the trimmer\r\n* Enable trimming for the following app types:\r\n  * Blazor\r\n  * Mobile apps\r\n  * ASP.NET\r\n  * Console apps\r\n  * Ideally an additional UI framework (e.g. WinForms or WPF)\r\n\r\n## Annotating the framework\r\n\r\nThis is a recursive initiative as each layer of the onion will potentially increase the surface area that can be trimmable and uncover additional APIs that need to be annotated. Decisions on which APIs should be focused on should be driven by usage stats (if we have them).\r\n\r\n## Annotating Libraries\r\n\r\nMost customer applications make use of libraries from third parties, commonly via NuGet, those also need to be annotated for trimming. We need to provide tooling to assist the developers in determining which of their APIs need to be annotated, and how to annotate them. The current library analysis uses hidden command line switches and needed to be augmented with custom tools created by the engineer currently working on annotations. The experience needs to be exposed in Visual Studio for both library consumers and library authors, with the ability to drill into the specifics of which API dependencies are causing issues.\r\n\r\nWe will need an outreach program for library authors, and probably have a way to filter out packages that are not trimmable from NuGet searches.\r\n\r\n## AOT annotations\r\n\r\nAll the annotations for trimming also assist in native AOT scenarios, as that has the same problem with not being able to determine dependencies when reflection is used. There are some additional limitations of native AOT that needs similar annotations to the attributes used for trimming. This should be added early so that the annotation exercise can consider both scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Work Items\r\n\r\n- [ ] TBD",

The most prominent one is the so called \u201Cplugin\u201D model where the application (host) loads other components to augment its functionality in some way. Such components are typically loaded into separate load contexts to avoid dependency collisions. Additionally, in some apps it\u2019s also desirable to be able to eventually unload such components either to free resources or to enable update of the component.\r\n\r\nProducing such applications has proven rather challenging in the current state of .NET Core because there are certain parts of the frameworks produces by us which are not compatible with multiple load contexts and/or unload ability.\r\nWe should drive the frameworks we own to fix these issues so that customer\u2019s code doesn\u2019t have to handle issues in frameworks they rely on. We should focus this effort on certain application types first to prioritize the work. We\u2019ve seen feedback on mainly ASP.NET and WPF applications. There might be overlap with the \u201Cfaster inner loop\u201D effort which would affect the prioritization as well.\r\n\r\nThe work can be split into two parts (and prioritized differently):\r\n* Given feature works correctly in presence of secondary load context \u2013 for example XamlParser has problems when used with assemblies in non-default load context. Similarly, ASP.NET\u2019s hosting code also doesn\u2019t work well in such a scenario. It might be possible to use static analyzers to detect some of the problems in this area.\r\n* Usage of a given feature doesn\u2019t prevent secondary load context from unloading correctly \u2013 for example TypeConverter holds onto all types which were used with it, and thus prevents unloading of such types. Static analyzers are probably not going to help in this area.\r\n\r\nIn both cases an important part of the work should be a general approach to testing \u2013 for example reuse existing test assets but run them under different conditions and providing customer guidance for first \u0026 third parties.\r\n\r\n# Work Items\r\n- [ ] TBD",

It\u0027s certainly a \u0022last mile\u0022 experience, but for example today you won\u0027t get any warnings if you try to use MemoryMappedFile.CreateNew(string, ...) with a non-null string path, even though only a null string path is supported on Linux and macOS. The current platform analyzer doesn\u0027t account for such possibilities, with annotations done to just say \u0022if any usage of this API works on a platform, then consider it supported on that platform\u0022. We should look at what APIs fall into those partially-supported buckets and consider ways of improving the experience around them. This might be the next issue developers porting to .NET 5 get hung up on from a cross-platform perspective.\r\n\r\nWe also realized that the platform vertical is not the only limiting factor for APIs availability.

While each is likely to be too big to be completed in .NET 6, we will start planning and making inroads for the rest of the stack and decide if we are comfortable introducing new libraries which may have no nullable annotations (e.g. mobile SDKs/Forms for .NET 6). An MVP (minimum viable product) for this, we believe (and will test) that any new libraries are annotated, moving forward nullable reference types are just part of the language, and when you decide the data type of some method parameter or return value, it\u0027s just one of the things you need to factor in, just as we need to factor in new types added in the libraries, new language features around optional parameters or params arguments and such things.\r\n\r\n# Work Items\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Annotate remainder of .NET Core assemblies for nullable reference types](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/41720)\r\n- [ ] [Turn Nullable on for new projects](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/14272)",

This is not very different from what we see with OS LTS versions \u2013 enterprise customers go from one LTS to the next and skip the in-between SAC releases. Since .NET 6.0 will be the successor to 3.1 LTS we expect customers presently using 3.1 LTS and wanting to target the next LTS will pick 6.0 LTS. We will support 3.1 through December 2022, so once .NET 6.0 ships, customers will have 1 year to plan for, rebuild and test their apps and complete their deployment. Customers that cannot migrate their apps to 6.0 in this timeframe will probably ask us to provide longer support.  \r\n\r\nIf customers can successfully complete their migration forward in this 1-year period everyone benefits. So, it is in everyone\u2019s interest that we do everything we can to enable customers to come forward to 6.0 as easily, smoothly and quickly as possible. \r\n\r\nEpics under this Theme:\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Enterprises have a first class experience acquiring and deploying .NET 6.0](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/5240).\r\n- [ ] [Enterprises get first-class support when using .NET 6.0 on Linux](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/5333).\r\n- [ ] [Path to migrate an app from Framework to .NET 6.0 is well understood and streamlined](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/5396)",

This is difficult for them today because the installers/bits are only available on the public CDN and public Azure blob storage. Also the tools, scripts and release metadata we offer today is designed to work with these public end points.  Each customer is working around this in a different way, for e.g. one customer is packaging our installer with their source build in order to piggy-back with the build to get it over to the air-gapped cloud. Another is copying over bits from our public blob storage to their private blob storage and maintains its own version of install scripts that go to the private blob. We have work to do here to make it easier for customers that need to use Core in air-gapped scenarios. \r\n\r\nA key question is which distributions types (zips, MSIs, debs, containers) are the most critical to participate in air-gapped flows. Also, Azure- air-gapped versus on-prem air-gapped. \r\n \r\nThis area needs further customer development.  ",

It is supported by all major browsers, although isn\u2019t browser-specific. We expect more general uses of WebAssembly to become commonplace in the coming years. It is important that .NET developers can publish apps to environments that support WebAssembly.\r\n\r\nWe released a first version of support for WebAssembly with [Bazor WebAssembly 3.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/blazor-webassembly-3-2-0-now-available/). It was based on the Mono runtime and libraries. [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/uno-platform-for-web-webassembly/) also relies on Mono for its WebAssembly support.\r\n\r\nIn .NET 5.0, we will continue to use the Mono runtime, and will switch to using the .NET 5.0 libraries. There are two major benefits to this change: better throughput performance, and higher compatibility with .NET 5.0 non-WebAssembly code. The compatbility isn\u2019t perfect, since we\u2019re using two different runtimes (Mono for WebAssembly and CoreCLR for everything else), and the WebAssembly environment imposes restrictions on what .NET code can do.\r\n\r\nThe following work items describe the work items required for the project. These bullets will be changed to links as we create new issues for them.\r\n\r\nMono Runtime Performance\r\n\r\n-\tInterpreter performance improvements\r\n-\tV8 performance improvement reports\r\n- Add browser wasm support for BenchmarkDotNet\r\n\r\nAdopt .NET Runtime Libraries\r\n\r\n-\tAdd support for browser based networking\r\n-\tEnable globalization with ICU\r\n-\tSupport async/tasks in an environment without explicit threads\r\n-\tAdd new library decorations and IL linker capabilities to reduce final application sizes and improve trimming reliability\r\n\r\nSDK\r\n\r\n- Create browser wasm runtime pack for net5.0 tfm\r\n- Add a reference to the runtime pack in SDK for building and publishing Blazor wasm projects",

        "DescriptionMarkdown": "# Improving credit for community contributions\r\n\r\nWe\u0027re nearly five years into [.NET Core as an open source project](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-open-source/). As a .NET team member and Microsoft rep, I want to share a big thanks to everyone in the community that has taken the time and interest to participate in the project. I would like to start a conversation about community credit and attribution. Right now, we don\u2019t have a consistent model in place that everyone can point to for giving credit for community contributions. That doesn\u0027t seem right, and I propose we fix it. What do you think?\r\n\r\nThe thesis of this document is that credit will be given more (both quantity and frequency) if everyone is empowered to give it, and that enabling more people to participate in credit giving will increase not diminish its meaningfulness.\r\n\r\n## What is credit?\r\n\r\n\u003E Dictionary: Public acknowledgment or praise, typically that given or received when a person\u0027s responsibility for an action or idea becomes or is made apparent\r\n\r\nLet\u0027s start with why credit is an important topic. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it\u0027s not necessary to give credit. Let\u0027s take one of the most well known contributors, [Ben Adams](https://github.com/benaadams). Anyone can query for  [Ben\u0027s commits](https://github.com/search?o=desc\u0026q=org%3Adotnet\u002Bis%3Apr\u002Bauthor%3Abenaadams\u0026s=committer-date\u0026type=Commits). It\u0027s all open, right? And, if you look at some of his merged PRs, you\u0027ll see people saying [thank you](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/35765#issuecomment-623204929) or [approving Ben\u0027s work without any fanfare](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32296) (an implicit validation of high-quality work). Sure, sure. I think we all know that this isn\u0027t credit, but basic personal interaction. \r\n\r\nSide-bar: Are we doing a good enough job on personal interaction, or are .NET team members too terse and business-like? Do you see and recieve enough appreciation in PRs and issues in the dotnet org? Tell us.\r\n\r\nBack to the main topic. Credit is something significantly beyond saying \u0022thank you.\u0022 Credit is given when a contribution is elevated so that everyone can see it. It\u0027s the higher level of visibility that\u0027s important. Here\u0027s an example from the [.NET 5.0 Preview 2 post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-5-0-preview-2/) where one of Ben\u0027s contributions is given a high level of visibility. FYI: This example of credit is only given to community members.\r\n\r\n\u003Cimg width=\u0022779\u0022 alt=\u0022Screen Shot 2020-06-06 at 9 54 59 PM\u0022 src=\u0022https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/83960687-9175a100-a840-11ea-8062-7be9547f09a0.png\u0022\u003E\r\n\r\nThere are similar examples in the [Preview 3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-5-0-preview-3/), [Preview 4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-5-preview-4-and-our-journey-to-one-net/) and [Preview 5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-5-0-preview-5/) posts. Visual Studio Code gives credit with their [Thank You section in their release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_45#_thank-you). The Xamarin team has a similar model in their [release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/release-notes/4.6/4.6.0-sr2#thank-you).\r\n\r\nOther projects focus on contributors of the month, like [Galaxy Project](https://galaxyproject.org/blog/2018-09-cotm-carrie-ganote/) and [Netdata](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues/7133). Note: These examples were found through searches. I have no idea what these projects do or what their history is.\r\n\r\n## Developing a better model for credit\r\n\r\n\u003E People appreciate and are motivated by credit for their contributions, ideas, and hard work. We need to find more and better ways to give people the credit they deserve and need.\r\n\r\nWe can develop and adopt a better and multi-faceted model. Here are some thoughts on what that might look like:\r\n\r\n* Clearly defined and regularly applied.\r\n* Managed as a joint project between the .NET Team and the community.\r\n* Broad definition of contributions (PRs and issues, code and docs, blog posts and videos, ...)\r\n\r\nIn a lot of ways, credit is just another project, that requires up-front thought, broad agreement on the value, and  features that need to be developed. While the goal of credit is admirable, we need to consider the regular care and feeding of a project focused on credit in order to satisfy the stated need. I propose we start with a good MVP (minimum viable product) in the dotnet/runtime repo, and watch how it is received. We can then extend or adjust (more repos, more ways of giving credit) from there.\r\n\r\nThe following is a proposal. It is a layered model that is intended to give 100% of contributors credit, enable both the community and Microsoft to play key roles, and start us down the path of more innovative models for credit giving.\r\n\r\n- Publish contributor lists for each release (for the whole product, not just the runtime repo)\r\n  - We did this [up until .NET Core 2.1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.1/2.1.0-contributor.md). Producing this list was unintentionally dropped as a release activity.\r\n  - Many projects product contributor lists in various forms. Mozilla\u0027s [evergreen list of contributors](https://www.mozilla.org/credits/) is a good example.\r\n  - Question: Do you like [this format](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.1/2.1.0-contributor.md), or should we adopt a new one? Should it include GitHub avatars? Is it important to split contributors by repo? Should Microsoft and community contributions be mixed or separated (FYI: they have been mixed to date, and it is a technically simpler approach)? Should we look at an existing tool/model like [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/)?\r\n- Create a community-maintained contribution epic linked to from the [release epic](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37269).\r\n  - The epic would be called \u0022Community contributions\u0022.\r\n  - The comunity would decide the bar for adding PRs/issues to its epic, and also the categorization within the epic.\r\n  - GitHub permissions are a challenge, so the community would need to pick an editor and then have that person create and maintain the issue.\r\n- Consider creating monthly issues that give credit more frequently for contributions (this would be a closer analogue to the VS Code \u0022thanks\u0022 approach, which is monthly)\r\n  - These contributor lists need to be significantly curated or adopt some other unique approach in order to provide value beyond the release-specific contributor lists.\r\n  - There are a many different (non-mututally-exclusive) approaches we could adopt/highlight: largest and most valuable contributions, first time contributors, multi-month contributors (\u003E6 months, \u003E12 months, ...), contribution with most reactions ([example](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/34393)), most interesting closed-not-merged contribution ([example](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/33152)), stale/closed community issue/PR that merits reconsideration ...\r\n  - This idea would require an ongoing and significant time investment. It would need a lot of community engagement (if not managed exclusively by the community) to keep alive.\r\n  - (re)Tweet these monthly issues from [@dotnet](https://twitter.com/dotnet) twitter account when they are published.\r\n- Continue to use the same approach to offering credit in the Microsoft blog posts for previews and releases.\r\n  - Link to the \u0022community contributions\u0022 epic and to monthly contributions issues.\r\n  - [For the .NET blog writer] Use those contribution issues for inspiration, to expand the offering of credit in the blog posts.\r\n- Consider an end-of-release blog post dedicated to community contributions\r\n  - This post might be written by the same people managing the community-contribution issues described earlier.\r\n- Ensure that Microsoft PRs that borrow from the community give credit\r\n   - A good example of giving credit: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/36405\r\n   - A not-yet-credited example ... we\u0027ve been working with @damageboy on his [this goes to 11](https://bits.houmus.org/2020-01-28/this-goes-to-eleven-pt1) project. Credit needs to be paid to [@damageboy](https://github.com/damageboy) as part of the 5.0 project.\r\n   - These type of contributions need to be elevated beyond contributor lists, including in the final 5.0 release blog post.\r\n\r\nIs this a good MVP? What else should we do or consider?\r\n\r\n## Diversity and inclusion (D\u0026I)\r\n\r\nThe credit topic is focused on raising people and their contributions up. This is an objectively noble goal, however, it\u0027s only truly noble if we also use it as an opportunity for change. It is widely known that women, people of color, LBTGQ\u002B folks, people with disabilities (visible and invisible), and other groups, are [under-represented in tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underrepresented_group#Underrepresented_groups_in_STEM). We need to find ways to increase, motivate and celebrate contributions from people under-represented in tech. Equally important, we should also motivate and celebrate people who step up, as allies, to mentor underrepresented people to participate in tech. Please help us explore other ways to help connect people with barriers to contribution with help.\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to bring D\u0026I into a topic as simple and straightforward as credit? Yes. This is a perfect opportunity for raising people up that have well-established barriers to participation. Putting aside the moral reasons to do this, these are large groups of people that do not have the same ability to participate (as established groups that participate), and may be forward-looking sources of great contributors.\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n\r\nThis .NET project started with Microsoft, but lives with the community. We need a set of community editors and curators to step forward to make much of this credit proposal real, and for the community to organize in some way to accept them as good stewards of community-generated credit giving.\r\n\r\nA better credit system is an overdue addition for ensuring that everyone in the community feels that their participation is appreciated and acknowledged. I\u0027ve offered some pretty obvious changes (like re-starting publishing contributor lists) and some more novel ones (like the \u0022community contributions\u0022 epic ). We can simply start with those if you want. We would like to start a dialog. Please share your thoughts.\r\n",

        "DescriptionMarkdown": "## Improving P95\u002B latency\r\n\r\nWe see an increasing number of large internet-facing sites and services being hosted on .NET. While there is a lot of legitimate focus on the [requests per second (RPS) metric](https://twitter.com/ben_a_adams/status/1260792649625280513), we find that very few big site owners ask us about that or even need to satisfy throughput approaching 1000 RPS (1000 RPS == 86M requests per day). We hear a lot more about latency, specifically about improving [P95 or P99 latency](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/internet-analyzer/internet-analyzer-scorecard). Often, the number of machines or cores that are provisioned for (and biggest cost driver of) a site are chosen based on achieving a specific P95 metric (for example, 200ms), as opposed to a lower P50 metric (for example, 50ms). We think of latency as being the true \u201Cmoney metric\u201D.\r\n\r\nWe want .NET to be a platform that makes it cheaper to host your applications with each new release. In order to achieve that, it\u0027s important that latency is both good (low) but also predictable. That\u0027s the whole point of measuring P95\u002B latency. We have increased our focus on predictably consistent performance, reducing performance cliffs and outliers, with an emphasis on P95\u002B latency.\r\n\r\nAn equally important theme is predictable performance. Some of these epics are more related to that, then specifically targeting P95 latency. We\u0027re going to be a bit lazy here, and mix the two topics.\r\n\r\n## GC\r\n\r\n* [Card mark stealing for better work balance in Server GC](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/25986)\r\n* [Optimize decommitting GC heap memory pages](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/35896)\r\n * [Pinned object heap](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32283) to reduce heap fragmentation caused by pinning\r\nReduce GC pause times in specific situations, like [Array.Copy](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27776), [Array.Sort](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/35297) or [object unboxing](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32353#issuecomment-586642480)\r\n\r\n## Runtime\r\n\r\n* [Improve call counting mechanism](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32250) used by tiered JIT compilation to smooth out performance during startup\r\n* [Casting in a loop may cause long GC pause times](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13821)\r\n* [Dynamic expansion of internal generic dictionary](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32270) that eliminate performance cliffs hit by generic code\r\n* [Fix for solving lock contention issue in GC statics scanning](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32795)\r\n* [GC polling in unboxing JIT helpers](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32353#issuecomment-586642480)\r\n* [Buffer::BlockCopy may spend too long without GC polling](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13554)\r\n* [Calling System.Math floating point operations in a loop causes long GC pause times ](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13820)\r\n* [Inlined GC poll for methods marked with SuppressGCTransitionAttribute](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13582)\r\n\r\n## Libraries\r\n\r\n* [Very high latency for GC when using (lots of) ThreadLocal](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/2382)",

        "Title": "[Mono] Add QCalls to the runtime",
        "DescriptionMarkdown": "In CoreCLR QCalls ([documented in botr](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/design/coreclr/botr/corelib.md#calling-from-managed-to-native-code)) are one way to call back into the runtime from managed code.  They are basically P/Invokes, but with a lookup that goes through a runtime table.\r\n\r\nSupporting QCalls in Mono will have a couple of benefits:\r\n1. Less churn on the managed side of S.P.C when it makes sense we can just share managed declarations instead of having to mark them with \u0060[MethodImpl (MethodImplOptions.InternalCall)]\u0060 for Mono and as a QCall for CoreCLR.\r\n2. We won\u0027t need to make the native symbols visible - right now for \u0060DllImport (__Internal)\u0060 - which we\u0027ve used for the ICU shims and some System.Native methods that we link into the MonoVM, we rely on \u0060dlsym\u0060 which means the symbol needs to be visible.  And also we have to do hacks for \u0060RTLD_LOCAL\u0060 in order for lookups to work both in the runtime and in the embedding host on Android, OSX, etc.  With QCalls the lookup logic doesn\u0027t depend on dlsym - we just build a table at runtime.\r\n3. Ability to share more native code - since QCalls are just PInvokes they will run in GC Safe mode and will need to switch to GC Unsafe when they call into the runtime APIs.  This is similar to how these methods behave in CoreCLR, so for projects like the EventPipe C implementation we can have uniform logic around thread GC state transitions.\r\n\r\nDownsides:\r\n1. Transitions from GC Unsafe (which managed code uses) to GC Safe (when going to a P/Invoke) aren\u0027t free.  Which is why CoreCLR has a \u0060SuppressGCTransitionAttribute\u0060 https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/30741 attribute which we should also implement.\r\n2. A table in the runtime means we\u0027ll need to do \u0060#ifdef\u0060 stuff to remove definitions for methods that shouldn\u0027t be in a particular runtime configuration.  Can\u0027t just rely on not linking the functions into the final binary.\r\n3. There will still be differences in how the native code is implemented. For passing object references to native code, CLR uses a [\u0060REF\u003CT\u003E\u0060](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/coreclr/src/vm/vars.hpp#L228)  C\u002B\u002B template (or rather specific the base class \u0060OBJECTREF\u0060 or instances like \u0060SAFEHANDLEREF\u0060) and we won\u0027t be able to make use of it in Mono directly.  Which means that sharing will only be possible in native code like the EventPipe C impl that already takes great care to abstract over the differences between CoreCLR and MonoVM\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n- [x] Add support for registering and looking up QCalls\r\n- [x] Add support for \u0060SuppressGCTransitionAttribute\u0060\r\n- [x] Share the \u0060QCallHandles\u0060 structs https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/coreclr/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Runtime/CompilerServices/QCallHandles.cs\r\n   - ~Add special marshalling support for these (or do they just work - unclear)~ these should just work\r\n   - we will need some implementations of \u0060GetUnderlyingNativeHandle\u0060 for \u0060Module\u0060 and \u0060Assembly\u0060 in our System.Reflection implementation.\r\n- [ ] Design and implement some analog of the \u0060REF\u003CT\u003E\u0060 template that we can use to pass object references to the C code in a relatively painless way.  ideally something that works with our \u0060object-internals.h\u0060 and \u0060handles.h\u0060 types.  Although the ideal with QCalls is to pass only a very limited number of object references to native code if it can be at all avoided.",

This includes calling APIs (in either direction; CLR \u003C==\u003E WinRT), marshaling of data between the two type systems, and unification of types that are intended to be single instance (i.e. \u0022projected types\u0022). We will be removing the existing WinRT interop system from the .NET runtime (and any other associated components) as part of .NET 5.0.\r\n\r\nWe will rely on a new set of tools provided by the WinRT team in Windows that will generate C#-based WinRT interop assemblies. We are currently working closely with that team. The tools will be delivered for .NET 5.0.\r\n\r\nThere are several benefits to the new system:\r\n* Can be developed and improved separate from the .NET runtime.\r\n* Symmetrical with interop systems provided for other OSes, like iOS and Android.\r\n* Can take advantage of many other .NET features (AOT, C# features, IL linking).\r\n* Simplifies the .NET runtime codebase.\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n* Allow the WinRT ecosystem to move independently of the .NET runtime with respect to WinRT projections.\r\n* Migration of existing applications and libraries to this new model should require minimal code changes. Creating a new project and recompilation is considered acceptable.\r\n* Provide a WinRT solution that is AOT and [ILLinker](https://github.com/mono/linker) friendly.\r\n* Permit the ability to remove built-in .NET Runtime support of WinRT. \r\n* Provide similar performance to what is available with .NET Core 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Non-Goals\r\n* Support existing WinMD-based managed WinRT assemblies.\r\n* Replace the MCG tool used by .NET Native.\r\n\r\n## .NET Runtime/SDK work\r\n- [x] Creation and management of [COM wrappers](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1845).\r\n  - [x] Support [\u0060ICustomQueryInterface\u0060](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/34717).\r\n  - [x] Provide [a mechanism to determine if \u0060ComWrappers\u0060 are being called from legacy APIs](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35530).\r\n  - [x] Ensure [\u0060IWeakReference\u0060](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/weakreference/nn-weakreference-iweakreference) continues to interact with the .NET types: [\u0060WeakReference\u0060](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.weakreference) and [\u0060WeakReference\u003CT\u003E\u0060](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.weakreference-1).

            "DescriptionMarkdown": "Work has begun to provide support for [WinUI 3.0](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md#winui-3). This support is expected to manifest in a way similar to the [CppWinRT](https://github.com/microsoft/cppwinrt) tool by way of a new source generation tool (e.g. CsWinRT). In order to support this new tool, APIs for integrating and coordinating with the runtime object lifetime are necessary.\r\n\r\n# Rationale and Usage\r\n\r\nThe below API surface provides a way for a third party tool to generate what are colloquially known as [Runtime Callable Wrappers](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/native-interop/runtime-callable-wrapper) (RCW) and [COM Callable Wrappers](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/native-interop/com-callable-wrapper) (CCW) in a way that allows safe interaction with managed object lifetime and identity.\r\n\r\nA specific example of the need for lifetime coordination is in WinRT scenarios involving UI (e.g.  WinUI 3.0) via the [\u0060IReferenceTrackerManager\u0060](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/windows.ui.xaml.hosting.referencetracker/nn-windows-ui-xaml-hosting-referencetracker-ireferencetrackermanager) interface.\r\n\r\n## Goals:\r\n* Enable source generation of interop code in WinRT/WinUI scenarios.\r\n* An API that generally aligns with how existing 3rd party source generators work (e.g. [SharpGenTools](https://github.com/SharpGenTools/SharpGenTools)).\r\n* Limit exposing APIs that manage lifetime in a micro way (e.g. avoid GC hooks at dangerous times).\r\n* Semantics in .NET Framework/.NET Core for WinRT scenarios should be able to be replicated.\r\n* Provide a mechanism for 3rd parties to be able to support [Reference Tracker scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/windows.ui.xaml.hosting.referencetracker/).\r\n* Ensure AOT scenarios are considered.\r\n\r\n## Non-Goals:\r\n* Replace the existing built-in RCW/CCW infrastructure.\r\n* Change anything related to P/Invoke Interop.\r\n* Hide WinRT and/or COM concepts.\r\n\r\n## Outstanding questions:\r\n * https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32091#discussion_r385491739\r\n * https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32091#discussion_r385498872\r\n\r\n# Proposed API\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060 CSharp\r\nnamespace System.Runtime\r\n{\r\n    public static partial class RuntimeHelpers\r\n    {\r\n        /// \u003Csummary\u003E\r\n        /// Allocate memory that is associated with the \u003Cparamref name=\u0022type\u0022/\u003E and\r\n        /// will be freed if and when the \u003Csee cref=\u0022System.Type\u0022/\u003E is unloaded.\r\n        /// \u003C/summary\u003E\r\n        /// \u003Cparam name=\u0022type\u0022\u003EType associated with the allocated memory.\u003C/param\u003E\r\n        /// \u003Cparam name=\u0022size\u0022\u003EAmount of memory in bytes to allocate.\u003C/param\u003E\r\n        /// \u003Creturns\u003EThe allocated memory\u003C/returns\u003E\r\n        public static IntPtr AllocateTypeAssociatedMemory(Type type, int size);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nnamespace System.Runtime.InteropServices\r\n{\r\n    /// \u003Csummary\u003E\r\n    /// Enumeration of flags for \u003Csee cref=\u0022ComWrappers.GetOrCreateComInterfaceForObject(object, CreateComInterfaceFlags)\u0022/\u003E.\r\n    /// \u003C/summary\u003E\r\n    [Flags]\r\n    public enum CreateComInterfaceFlags\r\n    {\r\n        None = 0,\r\n\r\n        /// \u003Csummary\u003E\r\n        /// The caller will provide an IUnknown Vtable.\r\n        /// \u003C/summary\u003E\r\n        /// \u003Cremarks\u003E\r\n        /// This is useful in scenarios when the caller has no need to rely on an IUnknown instance\r\n        /// that is used when running managed code is not possible (i.e. during a GC).

            "DescriptionMarkdown": "In #33485, we wired up the ComWrappers API to be called first-chance from the Marshal APIs and from the IL stub marshalers. This has started to prove a problem for CsWinRT, since there\u0027s no way to determine when to use the ComWrappers\u0027 implementation and when to use the runtime\u0027s built-in APIs.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the CsWinRT ComWrappers implementation of \u0060ComputeVtables\u0060 has to be able to handle all types, including types that do not implement any WinRT APIs, to correctly implement WinRT semantics for WinUI. Additionally, since WinUI depends on the reference tracking support from ComWrappers, the CsWinRT ComWrappers implementation has to be registered as the global implementation. As a result, if someone such as WPF calls \u0060Marshal.GetIUnknownForObject\u0060, this call will go down the ComWrappers route first if the Windows SDK is also being used. WPF is expecting to get the built-in runtime-implemented CCWs, but by default CsWinRT would provide one instead.\r\n\r\nThis proves to be a problem when the user (either WPF or someone else directly using the Marshal APIs or using COM objects in P/Invoke signatures) is trying to pass a managed implementations of COM APIs to native. CsWinRT\u0027s ComWrappers only support the WinRT model (as it should be, they shouldn\u0027t have to completely re-implement the runtime\u0027s CCW/RCW implementation), so they would create a WinRT CCW of the managed object.\r\n\r\nWe could attempt to use a heuristic in the CsWinRT ComWrappers implementation to determine whether to use the ComWrappers or just return null and fall back, but that heuristic may be tricky or downright impossible to get exactly right. I\u0027ve included an example below where the heuristic is extremely difficult if not impossible:\r\n\r\nLet\u0027s take a class \u0060class Foo : System.Collections.IEnumerable { ... }\u0060 and a P/Invoke signature \u0060void Bar(System.Collections.IEnumerable ienum)\u0060. In the WinRT world, we would want to treat this as a \u0060Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Interop.IBindableIterable\u0060. However, the built-in CCW system would generate an \u0060IDispatch\u0060 implementation that exposes the \u0060GetEnumerator\u0060 method as \u0060DISPID_NEWENUM\u0060.\r\n\r\nSince there is no way to determine from within a \u0060ComWrappers\u0060 implementation if it is being called from the \u0060Marshal\u0060 APIs or a P/Invoke marshaler (without attempting to just look up the call stack), the CsWinRT ComWrappers would never be able to know if it should marshal an instance of \u0060Foo\u0060 itself or if it should let the runtime marshal it.\r\n\r\nThere is a corresponding problem for the RCW direction, but using a heuristic of \u0022does this object implement IInspectable\u0022 works well as a heuristic for ComWrappers.\r\n\r\nThere are a few possible solutions here:\r\n- Provide an additional flag on the \u0060CreateObjectFlags\u0060 and \u0060CreateComInterfaceFlags\u0060 enumeration to denote when the ComWrappers methods are being called from the \u0060Marshal\u0060 APIs or from an IL stub.\r\n- Remove the support wiring up a ComWrappers instance as a first-chance handler for the Marshal APIs or from an IL stub.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m also open to additional ideas.\r\n\r\ncc: @AaronRobinsonMSFT @elinor-fung @jkotas ",

            "DescriptionMarkdown": "## Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nIn the .NET Native runtime support existed for a .NET class to participate in a C-style cast when that class didn\u0027t support the cast-to type. The COM [\u0060QueryInterface()\u0060](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/com/queryinterface--navigating-in-an-object) is an example where this kind of scenario exists. In COM, the instance is represented by an opaque \u0060IUnknown\u0060 pointer and the only way to discover what is supported by the instance is to call \u0060QueryInterface()\u0060 with a \u0060GUID\u0060 representing the question of \u0022Does this instance support this type?\u0022. The answer is typically a simple \u0022yes\u0022 (\u0060S_OK\u0060) or \u0022no\u0022 (\u0060E_NOINTERFACE\u0060). If the answer is \u0022yes\u0022, a casted to instance of the type is returned, otherwise \u0060null\u0060. There are scenarios where the current instance may not have implemented this type but can provide an instance that does - this is called a tear-off.\r\n\r\nIn .NET, the metadata for a type is static and therefore if a type can\u0027t be cast to another type because it isn\u0027t in metadata that is correct. This means that a type has no reason to participate in the casting question. However, when implementing support for a COM scenario this rigidity isn\u0027t as beneficial since it may not be possible to know all the supported types on an instance. This proposal provides a way to let types provide an answer and an \u0060object\u0060 instance that does satisfy the requested type eventhough the original instance does not and still adhere to the static metadata constraints of .NET.\r\n\r\nIn .NET Native there are two mechanisms to address this problem. The first, \u0060ICastable\u0060 interface, proved to have usability issues. Usage of the \u0060ICastable\u0060 API was error prone and had a potentially catastrophic consequence if used incorrectly - silent success or an unstable runtime. The [\u0060ICastable\u0060 API][icastable_link] exists in the CoreCLR runtime but is not publicly exposed and exists only to support MCG scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe second approach was \u0060CastableObject\u0060. This approach didn\u0027t return a type but instead returned an actual \u0060object\u0060 instance to dispatch on. The \u0060CastableObject\u0060 type is an \u0060abstract\u0060 type that contained some minor state for caching purposes. This approach did require inserting a new type into the user\u0027s type hierarchy. Updating the type hierarchy and the stored state of the \u0060abstract\u0060 type made this solution more reliable, but less performant than \u0060ICastable\u0060.\r\n\r\nFor CoreCLR, the following proposal is based on lessons learned from .NET Native along with a recent C# language feature, [default interfaces](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/default-implementations-in-interfaces/), that make a modified version of the \u0060ICastable\u0060 approach easier to implement with confidence.

We will need to define the exact semantics and requirements here.\r\n- Virtual Stub Dispatch (VSD) caching.\r\n    - \u0060ICastableObject\u0060 could control casting on a per object basis, as we can easily call \u0060GetInterfaceImplementation()\u0060 at each cast opportunity.\r\n    - \u0060ICastableObject\u0060 would control the result of a dispatching on an interface at a per TYPE level. So, a given type could not use different default interface type (e.g. \u0060IFooImpl\u0060) for different instances. This would be sufficient for any plausible use of this feature for interop, but it might impact useablility for aspect oriented programming, etc. \r\n    - The end result is that a given object may or may not implement the interface, but if it does, all implementations must be the same.\r\n- By throwing an exception from the interface impl the debugger will report the exception as coming from that type. We should suggest to users of this API to utilize some debugger attributes to make everything look normal. \r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\nConsider the following interface and class.\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060 CSharp\r\n\r\ninterface IFoo\r\n{\r\n    int CallMe(int i);\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Baz\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Bar : ICastableObject\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    // Call when cast is performed on an instance of Bar but the type isn\u0027t in Bar\u0027s metadata.\r\n    RuntimeTypeHandle ICastableObject.GetInterfaceImplementation(RuntimeTypeHandle interfaceType, bool throwIfNotFound)\r\n    {\r\n        Debug.Assert(interfaceType.Value != IntPtr.Zero);\r\n\r\n        if (interfaceType == typeof(IFoo).TypeHandle)\r\n            return typeof(IFooImpl).TypeHandle;\r\n        \r\n        if (throwIfNotFound)\r\n        {\r\n            var typeName = Type.GetTypeFromHandle(interfaceType).FullName;\r\n            throw new InvalidCastException($\u0022Don\u0027t support {typeName}\u0022);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return default;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // An \u0022implemented\u0022 interface instance that will handle \u0022this\u0022 of type \u0022Bar\u0022.\r\n    // Note that when this default interface implementation is called, the \u0022this\u0022 will\r\n    // be typed as a \u0022IFooImpl\u0022.\r\n    [CastableObjectImplementation]\r\n    public interface IFooImpl : IFoo\r\n    {\r\n        int IFoo.CallMe(int i)\r\n        {\r\n            // Perform desired action on the \u0022this\u0022 pointer which will be of type Bar.\r\n            //  - Cast to some other type\r\n            //  - Unsafe.As\u003CT\u003E()\r\n            //  - Table look up\r\n            //  - etc.\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of usage.\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060CSharp\r\nBaz z = ...;\r\n\r\n// Will result in InvalidCastException being thrown.\r\nIFoo zf = (IFoo)z;\r\n\r\nBar b = ...;\r\n\r\n// However, since Bar implements ICastableObject, GetInterfaceImplementation will be called.\r\nIFoo bf = (IFoo)b;\r\n// bf is a Bar.IFooImpl with a Bar \u0027this\u0027\r\n\r\n// Will call Bar.IFooImpl.CallMe()\r\nbf.CallMe(27);\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n## Community impact\r\n\r\n- Expose \u0060ICastable\u0060 request: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/23727\r\n- How MCG supported COM: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/10572#issuecomment-400129044\r\n- Discussion for \u0060ICastable\u0060: https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/4219#issuecomment-623671255\r\n- Support in \u0060ComWrappers\u0060 API: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35929\r\n- Mono request: https://github.com/mono/mono/issues/9423\r\n\r\n\u003C!-- Links --\u003E\r\n[icastable_link]: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Runtime/CompilerServices/ICastable.cs\r\n",

            "DescriptionMarkdown": "Work has begun to provide support for [WinUI 3.0](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md#winui-3). This support is expected to manifest in a way similar to the [CppWinRT](https://github.com/microsoft/cppwinrt) tool by way of a new source generation tool (e.g. CsWinRT). In order to support this new tool, APIs for integrating and coordinating with the runtime object lifetime are necessary.\r\n\r\n# Rationale and Usage\r\n\r\nThe below API surface provides a way for a third party tool to generate what are colloquially known as [Runtime Callable Wrappers](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/native-interop/runtime-callable-wrapper) (RCW) and [COM Callable Wrappers](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/native-interop/com-callable-wrapper) (CCW) in a way that allows safe interaction with managed object lifetime and identity.\r\n\r\nA specific example of the need for lifetime coordination is in WinRT scenarios involving UI (e.g.  WinUI 3.0) via the [\u0060IReferenceTrackerManager\u0060](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/windows.ui.xaml.hosting.referencetracker/nn-windows-ui-xaml-hosting-referencetracker-ireferencetrackermanager) interface.\r\n\r\n## Goals:\r\n* Enable source generation of interop code in WinRT/WinUI scenarios.\r\n* An API that generally aligns with how existing 3rd party source generators work (e.g. [SharpGenTools](https://github.com/SharpGenTools/SharpGenTools)).\r\n* Limit exposing APIs that manage lifetime in a micro way (e.g. avoid GC hooks at dangerous times).\r\n* Semantics in .NET Framework/.NET Core for WinRT scenarios should be able to be replicated.\r\n* Provide a mechanism for 3rd parties to be able to support [Reference Tracker scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/windows.ui.xaml.hosting.referencetracker/).\r\n* Ensure AOT scenarios are considered.\r\n\r\n## Non-Goals:\r\n* Replace the existing built-in RCW/CCW infrastructure.\r\n* Change anything related to P/Invoke Interop.\r\n* Hide WinRT and/or COM concepts.\r\n\r\n## Outstanding questions:\r\n * https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32091#discussion_r385491739\r\n * https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32091#discussion_r385498872\r\n\r\n# Proposed API\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060 CSharp\r\nnamespace System.Runtime\r\n{\r\n    public static partial class RuntimeHelpers\r\n    {\r\n        /// \u003Csummary\u003E\r\n        /// Allocate memory that is associated with the \u003Cparamref name=\u0022type\u0022/\u003E and\r\n        /// will be freed if and when the \u003Csee cref=\u0022System.Type\u0022/\u003E is unloaded.\r\n        /// \u003C/summary\u003E\r\n        /// \u003Cparam name=\u0022type\u0022\u003EType associated with the allocated memory.\u003C/param\u003E\r\n        /// \u003Cparam name=\u0022size\u0022\u003EAmount of memory in bytes to allocate.\u003C/param\u003E\r\n        /// \u003Creturns\u003EThe allocated memory\u003C/returns\u003E\r\n        public static IntPtr AllocateTypeAssociatedMemory(Type type, int size);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nnamespace System.Runtime.InteropServices\r\n{\r\n    /// \u003Csummary\u003E\r\n    /// Enumeration of flags for \u003Csee cref=\u0022ComWrappers.GetOrCreateComInterfaceForObject(object, CreateComInterfaceFlags)\u0022/\u003E.\r\n    /// \u003C/summary\u003E\r\n    [Flags]\r\n    public enum CreateComInterfaceFlags\r\n    {\r\n        None = 0,\r\n\r\n        /// \u003Csummary\u003E\r\n        /// The caller will provide an IUnknown Vtable.\r\n        /// \u003C/summary\u003E\r\n        /// \u003Cremarks\u003E\r\n        /// This is useful in scenarios when the caller has no need to rely on an IUnknown instance\r\n        /// that is used when running managed code is not possible (i.e. during a GC).

Typical \u0060.runtimeconfig.json\u0060: \r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060JSON\r\n{\r\n  \u0022runtimeOptions\u0022: {\r\n    \u0022tfm\u0022: \u0022netcoreapp3.1\u0022,\r\n    \u0022framework\u0022: {\r\n      \u0022name\u0022: \u0022Microsoft.NETCore.App\u0022,\r\n      \u0022version\u0022: \u00223.1.0\u0022\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nThe value comes directly from the \u0060\u003CTargetFramework\u003E\u0060 property in the project file.\r\n\r\nThe value in \u0060.runtimeconfig.json\u0060 is used only in two relatively fringe scenarios in the host:\r\n* When the host probes for shared store paths, the path is in the form of \u0060$DOTNET_SHARED_STORE/|arch|/|tfm|\u0060 where the \u0060|tfm|\u0060 is replaced by the value from the \u0060tfm\u0060 property.\r\n* When the host probes for additional paths (specified as either command line or config options) the path can contain the string \u0060|arch|/|tfm|\u0060 where it\u0027s again replaced with the value of the \u0060tfm\u0060 property.\r\n\r\nThe most common usage of these is the \u0060.runtimeconfig.dev.json\u0060 (auto-generated by SDK during \u0060dotnet build\u0060) which contains path to the user-local shared store:\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060JSON\r\n{\r\n  \u0022runtimeOptions\u0022: {\r\n    \u0022additionalProbingPaths\u0022: [\r\n      \u0022C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\.dotnet\\\\store\\\\|arch|\\\\|tfm|\u0022,\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nand then any usage of the shared store, where the folder structure on disk must match the TFM used in the configuration file.\r\n\r\nIf we keep the behavior as is, it would mean that these shared store paths would now include the full TFMs - like \u0060net5.0-windows10.0\u0060 or similar.\r\n\r\nWithout any changes the shared store may need to have multiple copies of the same file for all of the hierarchical TFMs: \u0060net5\u0060, \u0060net5.0\u0060, \u0060net5.0-windows\u0060 and \u0060net5.0-windows10\u0060 if it would server multiple apps each using slightly different but still fully compatible TFM.\r\n\r\nThe question is if the SDK should write the \u0022Simple\u0022 TFM into the \u0060.runtimeconfig.json\u0060 - in this case probably \u0060net5.0\u0060 or if the host will have to start understanding the hierarchical nature of TFMs and be able to parse them.",

            "DescriptionMarkdown": "As part of the spec for the [.NET 5 TFM work](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/92) we identified an issue with TFM checks in conditions.\r\n\r\n\u003Cdetails\u003E\r\n\u003Csummary\u003E\r\nBackground on MSBuild evaluation\r\n\u003C/summary\u003E\r\n\r\nIn SDK-style projects there are two kinds of MSBuild files that are automatically included into each project:\r\n\r\n* \u0060*.props\u0060: These files are included at the top of the user\u0027s project file and are used to define a set of default properties that the user\u0027s project file can use.\r\n\r\n* \u0060*.targets\u0060. These files are included at the bottom of the user\u0027s project file, usually meant to define build targets and additional properties/items that need to depend on properties defined by the user.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, MSBuild has a multi-pass evaluation model where properties are evaluated before items.\r\n\r\nWhy is all of this important? Because it controls which properties the user can rely on in their project file.\r\n\r\nOften, a user wants to express a condition like \u0022include this file if you\u0027re compiling for .NET 5 or higher\u0022. Logically one would like to express it like this:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060xml\r\n\u003CItemGroup Condition=\u0022\u0027$(TargetFramework)\u0027 \u003E= \u0027net5.0\u0027\u0060\u0022\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nbut this doesn\u0027t work because that would be a string comparison, not a version comparison. Instead, the user has to write it like this:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060xml\r\n\u003CItemGroup Condition=\u0022\u0027$(TargetFrameworkIdentifier)\u0027 == \u0027.NETCoreApp\u0027 AND \u0027$(TargetFrameworkVersion)\u0027 \u003E= \u00273.0\u0027\u0022\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nThis works for conditions on item groups because they are evaluated after properties. Since the user\u0027s project file defines the \u0060TargetFramework\u0060 property, the SDK logic that expands it into the other properties such as \u0060TargetFrameworkIdentifier\u0060 and \u0060TargetFrameworkVersion\u0060 has to live in \u0060*.targets\u0060, i.e. at the bottom of the project file. That means these automatically expanded properties aren\u0027t available for the user when defining other properties. This happens to work for items because items are evaluated after all properties are evaluated.\r\n\u003C/details\u003E\r\n\r\nDue to MSBuild evaluation order the user cannot define properties like this:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060XML\r\n\u003CProject Sdk=\u0022Microsoft.NET.Sdk\u0022\u003E\r\n\r\n  \u003CPropertyGroup\u003E\r\n    \u003CTargetFrameworks\u003Enetstandard2.0;netcoreapp3.1\u003C/TargetFramework\u003E\r\n  \u003C/PropertyGroup\u003E\r\n\r\n  \u003CPropertyGroup Condition=\u0022\u0027$(TargetFrameworkIdentifier)\u0027 == \u0027.NETStandard\u0027\u0022\u003E\r\n    \u003CSomeProperty\u003ESome .NET Standard specific value\u003CSomeProperty\u003E\r\n  \u003C/PropertyGroup\u003E\r\n\r\n  \u003CPropertyGroup Condition=\u0022\u0027$(TargetFrameworkIdentifier)\u0027 == \u0027.NETCoreApp\u0027\u0022\u003E\r\n    \u003CSomeProperty\u003ESome .NET Core specific value\u003CSomeProperty\u003E\r\n  \u003C/PropertyGroup\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003C/Project\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nIn the past, we\u0027ve seen people working this around by using string processing functions against the \u0060TargetFramework\u0060 property, which is less than ideal.\r\n\r\n### Option using attributes\r\n\r\nIdeally, we\u0027d expose functionality such that the user can do version checks:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060XML\r\n\u003CProject Sdk=\u0022Microsoft.NET.Sdk\u0022\u003E\r\n\r\n  \u003CPropertyGroup\u003E\r\n    \u003CTargetFrameworks\u003Enetstandard2.0;netcoreapp3.1\u003C/TargetFramework\u003E\r\n  \u003C/PropertyGroup\u003E\r\n\r\n  \u003CPropertyGroup TargetFramework=\u0022netstandard\u0022\u003E\r\n    \u003CSomeProperty\u003ESome value that applies to all versions of .NET Standard\u003CSomeProperty\u003E\r\n  \u003C/PropertyGroup\u003E\r\n\r\n  \u003CPropertyGroup TargetFramework=\u0022\u003E=netcoreapp2.0\u0022\u003E\r\n    \u003CSomeProperty\u003ESome value that applies to .NET Core 2.0 and later\u003CSomeProperty\u003E\r\n  \u003C/PropertyGroup\u003E\r\n\r\n  \u003CPropertyGroup TargetFramework=\u0022==net5.0-ios13.0\u0022\u003E\r\n    \u003CSomeProperty\u003ESome value that only applies to .NET 5 \u002B iOS 13.0\u003CSomeProperty\u003E\r\n  \u003C/PropertyGroup\u003E\r\n\r\n  \u003CPropertyGroup TargetPlatform=\u0022windows\u0022\u003E\r\n    \u003CSomeProperty\u003ESome value that applies to all version of Windows\u003CSomeProperty\u003E\r\n  \u003C/PropertyGroup\u003E\r\n\r\n  \u003CPropertyGroup TargetPlatform=\u0022\u003E=ios-12.0\u0022\u003E\r\n    \u003CSomeProperty\u003ESome value that applies to iOS 12.0 and later\u003CSomeProperty\u003E\r\n  \u003C/PropertyGroup\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003C/Project\u003E\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nThe idea is:\r\n\r\n* Property groups, properties, and item groups get new attributes \u0060TargetFramework\u0060 and \u0060TargetPlatform\u0060.\r\n* The value can be prefixed with an optional conditional operator \u0060==\u0060, \u0060!=\u0060, \u0060\u003C\u0060, \u0060\u003C=\u0060, \u0060\u003E\u0060, and \u0060\u003E=\u0060.

        "DescriptionMarkdown": "The following classes/functions in the libraries have Intel x86/x64 intrinsics usage. These are where \u0060_ISA_.IsSupported()\u0060 is called. This information was collected manually and might not be complete. Some of these function names represent many overloads. There are some vectorized helper methods not shown here -- where a function calls \u0060IsSupported\u0060 and then calls a specific helper function to do the actual work, such as for SSE2 or AVX2 specifically. There are other cases where \u0060Vector\u003CT\u003E\u0060 is used, but arm64 already supports that (it should be verified that the arm64 \u0060Vector\u003CT\u003E\u0060 code is complete and performant).\r\n\r\nWhen each of these has added an arm64-specific intrinsics optimization, it should be \u0022checked off\u0022.\r\n\r\nThe sections below are ordered in the presumed priority order that they should be implemented in. (There is no assumed priority order for the individual functions in each section.)\r\n\r\nIt is expected that \u0060System.Collections.BitArray\u0060, \u0060System.Numerics\u0060, and \u0060System.SpanHelpers\u0060 will be \u0022arm64 intrinsi-fied\u0022 for .NET 5.

The runtime has AssemblyExtensions.TryGetRawMetadata API to handle this case, but there is no way to give the blob returned by TryGetRawMetadata to MetadataLoadContext. The assemblies not backed by physical file are rare today, but they are very likely going to become more common as part of the single-file project.\r\nI am wondering whether there should be a LoadFrom method that takes MetadataReaderProvider to address both these problems and/or whether we should expose a resolver that can resolve the runtime loaded assemblies for you.\r\n\r\nImplementation\\design TBD. One approach is to use runtime reflection over the dynamic assembly, and convert those from \u0060System.RuntimeType\u0060 to the MetadataLoadContext types (\u0060System.RoType\u0060).\r\n\r\n",

This seems to be a broader issue than the more specific dotnet/runtime#25595.\r\n\r\nThese configurations work:\r\n\r\n1. public interface, public base class.\r\n1. internal interface, internal base class, within the same assembly. But only when this is the *first* proxy ever generated.\r\n\r\nThese configurations *don\u0027t* work:\r\n\r\n1. public interface, internal base class.\r\n1. internal interface, internal base class, if another assembly has already provided an internal interface to generate a proxy for.\r\n\r\nThere were other odd configurations that similarly failed.\r\n\r\nSince I\u0027ve done this kind of feature before, I have a suspicion that the generated \u0060ProxyBuilder\u0060 assembly includes an [\u0060System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IgnoresAccessChecksToAttribute\u0060](https://github.com/microsoft/vs-mef/blob/21ca4f58145ae9e0e1560de287e112a608ed796f/src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Composition/Reflection/SkipClrVisibilityChecks.cs#L159) for the assembly that defines the interface. \r\nThe way I solved this is that each time I need to generate a proxy, [I evaluate all the assemblies that visibility checks must be skipped for](https://github.com/microsoft/vs-mef/blob/21ca4f58145ae9e0e1560de287e112a608ed796f/src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Composition/Configuration/MetadataViewGenerator.cs#L114) and create a new dynamic assembly for each unique set that I get. So multiple proxies are supported, and we reuse dynamic assemblies where possible but when the set of dynamic assemblies exceed any previously discovered set we have to start a new assembly.\r\n\r\nAdding more attributes to an existing dynamic assembly is ineffective because once you\u0027ve loaded the first type from the assembly, the CLR caches these attributes and doesn\u0027t notice when new ones are added.",

        "DescriptionMarkdown": "This issue is tracking the work that needs to be done for supporting the distributed context scenarios for ASP.NET and [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification).\r\n\r\nHere are the scenarios we need to support: \r\n\r\n## Distributed Context scenarios\r\nThese scenarios talking about ILogger and OpenTelemetry scenarios. OpenTelemetry has a goal to implement all these scenarios if you replace \u201CILogger\u201D with \u201COpenTelemetry Logging API\u201D. The goal of this document is to come up with scenarios that will not require OpenTelemetry to introduce new concepts and libraries. And out-of-the-box ASP.NET apps be more distributed apps friendly.\r\n\r\n### Out of the box ASP.NET application\r\n- Distributed trace identifiers are automatically propagated through the app. This enables the correlation of telemetry across multiple components even when only a subset of these components has monitoring enabled.\r\nNote: This is already implemented via DiagnosticsSource.Activity. \r\n\r\n- Log messages and exceptions are automatically associated with the distributed trace identifiers. This allows pinpointing the root cause of the problem faster by associating logs and exceptions with the downstream components that might have caused the problem or upstream - components providing incorrect data.\r\nNote: This is partially implemented - trace-id and span-id of a topmost request are added to the ILogger scope.\r\n\r\n- Users may output distributed trace identifiers as part of an error page for the app user reference. This allows improving application supportability by providing a fast lookup reference that will simplify customer communication with support personnel.\r\n\r\n### Scoping of distributed logs\r\n- The developer may add a name/value pairs to the scope of execution. This name/value pair will be associated with all logs captured in this scope\r\n\tNote: this is an existing ILogger feature\r\n\r\n- The developer may configure some of the name/value pairs in scope to be distributed. These scope values will be transmitted over the wire and associated with the logs reported by downstream services. This feature enables scenarios like clients sending client app versions as a context property and all logs across many layers of a distributed trace will be attributed to it.\r\n\r\n### ASP.NET app with OpenTelemetry enabled\r\n- When OpenTelemetry is enabled - all logs reported by ILogger must bye be attributed with the OpenTelemetry span identity. So telemetry reported by OpenTelemetry and ILogger can be cross-referenced.\r\n\r\n- Spans reported by OpenTelemetry can use the scope\u2019s name/value pairs configured by the customer for ILogger as dimensions for telemetry. This will ensure that OpenTelemetry benefits from app attribution made by the developer for better diagnostics experience. This includes both - local and distributed contexts.\r\n\r\n### Metrics and scopes\r\n- Metrics aggregation in OpenTelemetry may use the scope\u2019s name/value pairs as a dimension for aggregation based on configuration. This includes both - local and distributed contexts.\r\n\r\n- EventCounters may use the scope\u2019s name/value pairs as a dimension for aggregation. This includes both - local and distributed contexts.\r\n\r\n### Distributed \u201CHTTP context\u201D\r\n- The developer must be able to set up business-critical properties that can be used across the entire distributed trace.\r\n\r\n## Tracked work items:\r\n\r\n- [x] [Make Activity and Span the same.](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/31373) @tarekgh\r\n- [x] [Add Ids and Context to all logs.](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/34305) @tarekgh\r\n- [ ] [Distributed Context API (distributed http context)](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/31393).

            "DescriptionMarkdown": "This issue tracking the work as the part of the issue https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/31372\r\n\r\n## Rationale and Use Cases\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no automatic way to log the tracing context info with the logging scopes. Tracing context info is the trace Id, Span Id, Parent Id, Trace State, and Trace flags which included inside the Activity object stored in the current execution context. This issue is to support adding the tracing context info with the logging scopes.\r\n\r\nAdding Tracing context info to the logging scope will require some memory allocations and also will increase the produced text inside the logs, we are going to provide an opt-in option to enable the new behavior. Although the whole feature is about internal implementation details, we still need to expose some API for the opt-in option. ***All Proposed APIs here are only to provide the opt-in option for enabling the trace context info in logging and choose which parts of the trace context should be included***.\r\n\r\nHere is a code sample showing how to opt-in to include the trace context info in the logs.\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060C#\r\nvar loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder =\u003E\r\n{\r\n    // Enable logging trace context info in the logging scopes.\r\n    builder.Configure(factoryOptions =\u003E factoryOptions.ActivityTrackingOptions = ActivityTrackingOptions.Default);\r\n});\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\nWhen enable trace context info logging, will get in the logging results like the following:\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\ninfo: Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Test.ConsoleLoggerTest[0]\r\n      =\u003E SpanId:|30de9810-4985f5593b3c7f14.1., TraceId:30de9810-4985f5593b3c7f14, ParentId:|30de9810-4985f5593b3c7f14. =\u003E { Scope1 = 1 } =\u003E { Scope2 = 2 }\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n- ActiviyTrackingOptions is a flags enum has the values of which parts of the trace context can be included in the logs.\r\n- LoggerFactoryOptions is the new options type for the logger factory. Although it contains the only property ActivityTrackingOptions used to enable the trace context logging, this type can be extended in the future to include more options as needed. \r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060C#\r\nnamespace Microsoft.Extensions.Logging\r\n{\r\n    [Flags]\r\n    public enum ActivityTrackingOptions\r\n    {\r\n        None        = 0x0000,\r\n        SpanId      = 0x0001,\r\n        TraceId     = 0x0002,\r\n        ParentId    = 0x0004,\r\n        Default     = SpanId | TraceId | ParentId,\r\n        TraceState  = 0x0008,\r\n        TraceFlags  = 0x0010\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class LoggerFactoryOptions\r\n    {\r\n        public LoggerFactoryOptions() { }\r\n        public ActivityTrackingOptions ActivityTrackingOptions  { get {throw null; } set { throw null; } }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n- Adding more constructors to the existing LoggerFactory class. This addition mainly to have the Dependency Injection (DI) work nicely with the introduced LoggerFactoryOptions. \r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060C#\r\nnamespace Microsoft.Extensions.Logging\r\n{\r\n    // LoggerFactory is existing type\r\n    public partial class LoggerFactory : ILoggerFactory, System.IDisposable\r\n    {\r\n        public LoggerFactory(IOptions\u003CLoggerFactoryOptions\u003E options) { }\r\n        public LoggerFactory(IEnumerable\u003CILoggerProvider\u003E providers, IOptions\u003CLoggerFactoryOptions\u003E options) { }\r\n        public LoggerFactory(IEnumerable\u003CILoggerProvider\u003E providers, LoggerFilterOptions filterOptions, IOptions\u003CLoggerFactoryOptions\u003E options) { }\r\n        public LoggerFactory(IEnumerable\u003CILoggerProvider\u003E providers, IOptionsMonitor\u003CLoggerFilterOptions\u003E filterOption, IOptions\u003CLoggerFactoryOptions\u003E options) { }\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n\r\n- Adding the extension method Configure to the logger builder\r\n\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060C#\r\nnamespace Microsoft.Extensions.Logging\r\n{\r\n    // LoggingBuilderExtensions is existing type\r\n    public static partial class LoggingBuilderExtensions\r\n    {\r\n        public static ILoggingBuilder Configure(this ILoggingBuilder builder, Action\u003CLoggerFactoryOptions\u003E action) {...}\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\r\n",

Some of these benefits are improved startup time, and reduction in private memory usage and faster throughput for serialization and deserialization. After discussing some approaches and pros/cons of some of them we decided to implement this feature using [Roslyn source generators](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-c-source-generators/). Implementation details and code/usage examples can be seen in the [design document](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/pull/16/files). This document will outline the roadmap for the initial experiment and highlight actionable items.  \r\n\r\nThis is an intern project and experimental which is why we will be using the [dotnet/runtimelab](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/tree/JsonCodeGen) repository instead of [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime). The main goal of this project is to get something up and running while changing implementation and iterating on public API without committing to dotnet/runtime master. We hope to share the project and get feedback for potential release on .NET 6.0. The project will be consumable through a prerelease package until then. Progress can be tracked through the [JSON Code Gen project board](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/projects/1) in dotnet/runtimelab. \r\n\r\n## Approach \r\n\r\nThere are 3 main points in this project: type discovery, source code generation, generated source code integration (with user applications). \r\n\r\n### Type discovery \r\n\r\nType discovery can be thought of in two ways, an implicit model (where the user does not have to specify which types to generate code for) and an explicit model (user specifies through code  or configuration which types to generate code for). \r\n\r\nVarious implicit approaches have been discussed such as source generating for all partial classes or scanning for calls into the serializer using Roslyn tree syntax. These models can be revisited in the future as the value/feasibility of the approach becomes clearer based on user feedback. It is important to note that some downsides to such a model include missing types to generate source for or generating source for types when not needed due to a bug or edge cases we didn\u2019t consider. \r\n\r\nThe proposed approach for type discovery requires an explicit indication of serializable types by the user. This model supports indicating both owned and non-owned types. A new [\u0060JsonSerializableAttribute\u0060](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/blob/JsonCodeGen/src/libraries/System.Text.Json/src/System/Text/Json/Serialization/Attributes/JsonSerializableAttribute.cs) will be used to detect these types. There are two patterns for \u0060JsonSerializiableAttribute\u0060. The first consists of applying the attribute on a type that the user owns, and the second consists of the user passing into the constructor of the attribute a non-owned serializable type. \r\n\r\nWe believe that an explicit model using attributes would be a simple first-approach to the problem. Within the Roslyn source generator, we parse the syntax tree to find usages of the \u0060JsonSerializableAttribute\u0060. The output of this phase would be a list of input types for the generator in order to code-gen recursively for each type in all the object graphs. \r\n\r\n### Source code generation \r\n\r\nThe design for the generated source focuses mainly on performance gains and extensibility to existing \u0060JsonSerializer\u0060 functionality. Performance is improved in two ways. The first is during the first-time/warm-up performance for both CPU and memory by avoiding costly reflection to build up a Type metadata cache during runtime and moving it to compile time. These type metadata are then represented as [\u0060JsonTypeInfo\u0060](https://github.com/steveharter/runtimelab/blob/ApiAdds/src/libraries/System.Text.Json/src/System/Text/Json/Serialization/Metadata/JsonTypeInfoOfT.cs#L15) classes that can be used for (de)serialization at runtime. The second is throughput improvement by avoiding the initial metadata-dictionary lookup on calls to the serializer by generating an instance of the type\u2019s \u0060JsonTypeInfo\u0060 (metadata). These instances will be passed to [new (de)serialize overloads](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/compare/JsonCodeGen...steveharter:ApiAdds#diff-e6bf8cabf53ffaaaaf77cf53a9db85fcR59). \r\n\r\nWe will use the types discovered in the type discovery phase and recurse through the type graph in order to source generate the functions mentioned above within each \u0060JsonTypeInfo\u0060 and register them inside the user-facing wrapper \u0060JsonSerializerContext\u0060. \r\n\r\n### Generated source code integration \r\n\r\nThere are [discussions](https://gist.github.com/steveharter/d71cdfc25df53a8f60f1a3563d13cf0f) regarding integration of generated metadata source code with user apps.  The proposed approach consists of the generator creating a context class ([\u0060JsonSerializerContext\u0060](https://github.com/steveharter/runtimelab/blob/ApiAdds/src/libraries/System.Text.Json/src/System/Text/Json/Serialization/JsonSerializerContext.cs#L10)) which takes an options instance and contains references to the generated \u0060JsonTypeInfos\u0060 for each type seen above. This relies on the creation of new overloads to the current serializer mentioned before that can be retrieved from the context. An example of the overload and usage can be seen [here](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/compare/master...steveharter:ApiAdds), while examples and details of the end to end approach can be seen in the [design document](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/pull/16/files). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n## Action items: \r\n\r\n- [x] Implement and expose public API needed by the source generator ([in progress](https://github.com/steveharter/runtimelab/tree/ApiAdds) by @steveharter) \r\n\r\n- [x] Create source generator project in \u0060System.Text.Json\u0060 dotnet/runtimelab directory\r\n\r\n- [x] Create source generator unit test project\r\n\r\n- [x] Create source generator end-to-end test project\r\n\r\n  - [ ] Create infrastructure for performance benchmarking within the project \r\n\r\n- [x] Implement initial mechanism for type discovery \r\n\r\n  - [x] Implement and expose new \u0060JsonSerializableAttribute\u0060 from \u0060System.Text.Json\u0060. This will allow callers to indicate which types to generate serializers for (both user owned and non-user owned)  \r\n\r\n  - [x] Implement Roslyn syntax receiver to receive list of types to generate serializers for. \r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement, test, and benchmark source generator for POCOS (classes and structs) \r\n\r\n  - [ ] Share progress with partner teams and community \r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement, test, and benchmark source generator for collections \r\n\r\n  - [ ] Share progress with partner teams and community \r\n\r\n- [ ] Receive and react to user feedback \r\n\r\n  - [ ] Revisit and reconsider approaches taken in the initial experiment \r\n\r\n- [ ] Review and document unsupported JsonSerializer features within source generation feature \r\n\r\n- [ ] Polish end to end experience \r\n \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the approaches mentioned above are for the base prototype and that we will iterate with the community in order to receive feedback and change the approaches as needed. We believe that with the base prototype, most changes won\u2019t be difficult to implement at a later phase and won\u2019t regress too much in terms of work. Progress of this effort can be seen through the [JSON Code Gen project board](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/projects/1) in dotnet/runtimelab.\r\n\r\ncc @jkotas @davidfowl @stephentoub @mjsabby @terrajobst @pranavkm @ericstj @layomia @steveharter @chsienki",
